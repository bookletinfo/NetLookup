Project Description - IP Resolver
📌 Purpose of the Project:
This lightweight script can convert an IP address to a domain name and a domain name to an IP address.

🔍 How It Works:
The user inputs either an IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8) or a domain name (e.g., example.com).
The script checks if the input is numeric (IPv4) or text (domain name).
If the input is an IP address, the script performs a reverse lookup (PTR Record) to find its domain name.
If the input is a domain name, the script retrieves its IP address (A Record).
If the input is invalid, an appropriate error message is displayed.
⚙️ How to Run the Script:
Run the script using Python 3:

python main.py
Then enter the desired value.

📡 Benefits & Use Cases:
✔️ Check the relationship between an IP and a domain
✔️ Find the IP address of a website
✔️ Perform a reverse lookup on a server
✔️ Useful for network administrators and developers
